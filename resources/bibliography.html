  of works about declarative markup is, as all such lists
  must be, incomplete and based on the opinions of the contributors.
  The intent is to make available the widely scattered literature on
  the philosophy of markup that has been variously called “generic
  markup”, “descriptive markup”, and “declarative markup”. Works that
  have sections that are about declarative markup are within scope for
  this list, especially if annotated to point to the portion of the
  document that is <b>about</b> declarative markup per se. Works that
  are about particular declarative markup languages, declarative
  programming, XML, CSS, or any of hundreds of related concepts but
  that do not directly address <strong>declarative markup</strong>
  should be in the “Related Concepts” appendix of this bibliography,
  not in the body of the document.</p>

  <p>Annotations on this list are used to describe the work, point to
  portions of a work that are particularly relevant to declarative
  markup, and provide the annotator’s opinion on the work. All
  annotations should be signed by the annotator. We ask that if you
  disagree with an annotation you write an additional annotation with
  your point of view; do not edit, remove, or replace some else’s
  annotation.</p>

        <p>The importance of separating presentation from content is
        taken as a given in many kinds of publishing, despite the fact
        that the notion of separation has received little critical
        scrutiny. I provide a closer look at the separation, first by
        providing contemporary and historical context, then by laying
        out key distinctions in the ways the separation argument is
        used in Web design versus Web content management versus
        full-featured content management systems (CMSs). I suggest
        that these distinctions are critical in how we should view the
        separation and the implications of the separation for the work
        of technical communicators.</p>

        <p>This oft-cited paper is both a review of various solutions
        to the overlap problem, and a recommendation of yet another
        solution called HORSE. This solution, a clever style of typed
        segment-boundary delimiter (see <a href="Overlap01">TEI
        MLW18</a>) has become a particularly popular method for
        handling overlap. It was even recommended to the TEI-C by the

        <p>“The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a meta language, it is used 
          to describe other languages and as such it has been phenomenally 
          successful, it has been drawn into just about every information 
          domain imaginable, not to mention some you really can’t… When 
          looking at the extremes of XML, what I find fascinating is not how 
          much or how fast but the breadth of applications to which XML has 
          been applied, and this is what one could call the ‘XML Envelope’.”</p>

        <p>The first, best, and most authoratitive book on design of

        this book is the logic behind vocabulary design and that is

        <p>Conventionally, XML design and application methodologies
        propose that the format in which we create, store and maintain
        documentary data be isolated from the format of its
        presentation: this doctrine is usually designated as the
        “separation of format from content”, and the advantages of the
        layered architecture it implies are often cited as a
        compelling rationale for XML as a standards-based markup
        technology. Yet experienced markup designers know that in
        practice, the separation is often more easily described than
        achieved, and that this design decision (like any other)
        involves tradeoffs.</p>

          That was a long time ago. Since then many people, on many

        http://www.wiumlie.no/2006/phd/css.pdf</a> Thesis submitted for the

        University of Oslo Norway 2005
      </p>
      <div class="annotation">
        <p>From the Overview:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <h2>Chapter 2: Structured documents</h2>
          <p>Style sheet languages and structured documents are mutually
              dependent. Without style sheets, structured documents cannot be
              presented, and without structured documents there is nothing for
              style sheets to present. Chapter 2 starts by introducing the ladder
              of abstraction which is proposed as a measuring tool for structured
              document formats. Such formats developed prior to the web (Scribe,
              LaTeX, ODA, SGML) and for the web (HTML, XML) are described.
              Finally, the role of transformation languages vs. style sheet
              languages is discussed.</p>
          <h2>Chapter 3: Style sheets prior to the web</h2>
          <p>Chapter 3 is the first chapter in which style sheets are discussed in
              some detail. The first part of the chapter establishes a set of
              criteria for style sheet languages; in order to qualify as a style
              sheet language six components must be present: syntax, selectors,
              properties, values and units, value propagation and a formatting
              model. Three style sheet languages developed before the Web (FOSI,
              DSSSL and P94) are described. The historical background of each is
              followed by a technical review.</p>
          <h2>Chapter 4: Style sheet proposals for the web</h2>
          <p>This chapter is a survey of the style sheet languages that were
              proposed for the web in the period 1993-1996. Nine different
              proposals are reviewed according to the criteria established in the
              previous chapter.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Obviously, the rest of the thesis would be of particular interest to a
        reader interested in the declarative markup known as CSS.</p>

        <p>Its glossary definition of ‘declarative language’ may also be of
        interest:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <h2>declarative language</h2>
          <p>A declarative language is a general term for languages
          which express relationships between variables, as opposed to
          imperative languages which specify explicit sequences of
          steps to be followed, in order to produce a result. Often,
          declarative languages are not Turing-complete, while
          imperative languages are. All style sheet languages
          described in this thesis are declarative.</p>

        <p>Most of the XML Working Groups have been closed by now;
        this year saw XQuery and XSLT close, their work successfully
        completed.</p><p>As we wind down work on standardizing the XML
        stack at W3C it’s worth looking at some of what we have
        accomplished and why. W3C XML, the Extensible Markup Language,
        is one of the world’s most widely-used formats for
        representing and exchanging information. The final XML stack
        is more powerful and easier to work with than many people
        know, especially for people who might not have used XML since
        its early days.</p>

    <p>For each entry, we need the title of the work, the names of the

    (You can see how we’ll format that and put it on the page by looking
    at the examples above.)</p>

    <p>There are three options for contributing:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>If you want, you can just <a href="/contact">send it to us</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A little more work for you, but a little easier for us, would
        be to
        <a href="https://github.com/markupdeclaration/markupdeclaration.org/issues=">create an issue</a> that contains the details needed for the bibliography.

        <p>Finally, if you’re comfortable with GitHub and HTML, feel free to fork

        repository</a>, edit <code>_pages/04_01_bibliography.html</code>,
        and send us a pull request</p>
        <p>The markup is a little bit odd, we concede, because some of the
        publishing mechanics (<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>)
        bleed through into the content. We may try to fix that in the
        future. For now, just leave the extra few lines of text at the
        top of the file alone.</p>
