# Markup Declaration website

This repository is the source for the [markup declaration website](https://markupdeclaration.org/), which is currently published through GitHub with Jekyll. The main resource supported by this website is the [annotated bibliography](https://markupdeclaration.org/resources/bibliography), the source for which is (currently) in `_pages/04_01_bibliography.html` (if editing that file, please leave the top few lines alone as they are what manages its publication via Jekyll).

To [propose changes](https://github.com/markupdeclaration/markupdeclaration.org/wiki/How-to-edit-MarkupDeclaration.org) to the website in general or the bibliography in particular, please create an issue or make a pull request.
