# History

This movement has its genesis in threads of conversation that have
enlivened markup conferences
([Balisage](https://balisage.net/),
in particular, but also [XML Prague](http://xmlprague.cz),
[XML Amsterdam](http://xmlamsterdam.com/"), and others) for
years.

These are not explicitly technical conversations, but they are
conversations that many markup technologists feel have a growing
urgency.

This sense of urgency was crystallized at 2018’s inaugural
[MarkupUK](http://markupuk.org/)
conference, in the response to an excellent keynote paper by Tommie
Usdin _Shared Tag Sets as Social Constructs_. Tommie reminded us that
“Markup culture is time-saving, energy saving, and application
enabling”; markup culture centers human needs.

As a reply to Tommie’s paper, Bethan Tovey and Norm Walsh announced
“_Markup Declaration_” at Balisage 2018. They reminded us of the
needs supported by markup with its opposition to vendor lock-in and
code obfuscation, including the need to collaborate, the need to
share, and the need to form communities of practice.

At Balisage 2018, Steven Pemberton asked important questions about
where XML is going next; questions that we agree should be asked of
declarative markup more generally.

Thus: _Markup Declaration_
