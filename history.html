<p>This movement has its genesis in threads of conversation that have
enlivened markup conferences
(<a href="https://balisage.net/">Balisage</a>,
in particular, but also <a href="http://xmlprague.cz">XML Prague</a>,
<a href="http://xmlamsterdam.com/&#34;">XML Amsterdam</a>, and others) for
years.</p>
<p>These are not explicitly technical conversations, but they are
conversations that many markup technologists feel have a growing
urgency.</p>
<p>This sense of urgency was crystallized at 2018’s inaugural
<a href="http://markupuk.org/">MarkupUK</a>
conference, in the response to an excellent keynote paper by Tommie
Usdin <em>Shared Tag Sets as Social Constructs</em>. Tommie reminded us that
“Markup culture is time-saving, energy saving, and application
enabling”; markup culture centers human needs.</p>
<p>As a reply to Tommie’s paper, Bethan Tovey and Norm Walsh announced
“<em>Markup Declaration</em>” at Balisage 2018. They reminded us of the
needs supported by markup with its opposition to vendor lock-in and
code obfuscation, including the need to collaborate, the need to
share, and the need to form communities of practice.</p>
<p>At Balisage 2018, Steven Pemberton asked important questions about
where XML is going next; questions that we agree should be asked of
declarative markup more generally.</p>
<p>Thus: <em>Markup Declaration</em></p>
